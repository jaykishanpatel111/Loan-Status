# Loan-Status
In this project, we are using a dataset that contains information like loan id, gender education, etc, and using that to classify the loan status. We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, we perform a Gaussian naive Bayes classifier. We got 75% accuracy.
